# Character Game
## Project Name & Pitch
Name TBD

A simple web game allowing users to modify and personalize their avatars, built with Blender, ThreeJS, vanilla JavaScript, and SCSS.

## Status
This project is currently in development. A loading page will appear while assets and styling are loading, and then ask the user if they want to enable background music or not. Users can customize their appearance, including skin, eyes, hair, nose, mouth, and clothing. A settings button opens a modal to choose the theme and modify the volume of SFX/background music. Additional character animation is in progress.
